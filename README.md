         <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
         <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. </p>
     
         <h3>CSS Example</h3>
         <p>body {

            background-color: lightblue;

          }
          
          h1 {

            color: white;

            text-align: center;

          }
          
          p {

            font-family: verdana;

            font-size: 20px;

          }</p>
          <h4>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h4>
          <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
            
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            
            When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
            
            To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
            
            CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
            <h5>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h5>
            <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

                With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
       
       <title>CSS Outline</title>
       <p>An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.</p>

       <table>This element has a black border and a green outline with a width of 10px.</table>
       
       <p>An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".</p>
        <table1>Outline</table1>

        <table2>Border</table2>

        <table3>content</table3>

       <p>CSS has the following outline properties:

       .outline-style
       .outline-color
       .outline-width
       .outline-offset
       .outline
        Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.</p>
       
        <h6>CSS Outline Style</h6>

        <p>The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

            dotted - Defines a dotted outline
            dashed - Defines a dashed outline
            solid - Defines a solid outline
            double - Defines a double outline
            groove - Defines a 3D grooved outline
            ridge - Defines a 3D ridged outline
            inset - Defines a 3D inset outline
            outset - Defines a 3D outset outline
            none - Defines no outline
            hidden - Defines a hidden outline
            The following example shows the different outline-style values:</p>
